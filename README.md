Seems like weâ€™re doing Ice Dodo.

Ice Dodo has a clear structure in terms of model structure

input: the graphics in front of the player

- This is made easier by the fact that most levels are high contrast. This can be converted into 3-class input matrices (track, obstacle, void) and that should simplify the process enough for reinforcement learning to happen ok
  - Need to find levels that are distinct color palette                          
  - Use Low res version of ice dodo
  - How to map onto bitmap.
  - Variable FOV might be an issue
    - But it only happens between levels, not in them.
  - Converted using OBS filter???
    - OBS python addons for customisability
  - Then map single colors onto bitmap.
  - Use a library like [MoviePy](https://medium.com/@kapildevkhatik2/advanced-image-and-video-processing-techniques-using-python-549fb1cf224e)
    - Or openCV?
    - Color mapping: [Change the colors within certain range to another color using OpenCV - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50210304/change-the-colors-within-certain-range-to-another-color-using-opencv)

output: controls, arrows

- Juwon concerned about â€˜wrappingâ€™ but honestly why canâ€™t we just have artificial keyboard input controlling the game

Model should be rewarded by time survived. If they finish the level, then some high-ass reward.

- Juwon concerned about manipulating the system by just going around in circles to survive
  - Solution may be in capping runtime/model at 5mins (and then giving 0 reward). Also, we can cherry-pick levels

Speaking of cherry-picking levels

- We are confident that this structure will work with 2d/flat levels
  - Juwon: However with 3d levels, might be different
    - Chris thinks that we can just train on 3d levels anywaysâ€¦ weâ€™re in it to see if it works or not

Therefore if we are to pursue this, the following questions need to be answered:

- How do we take the area in front of the player as input?
  - Screen record specific area?
- How to classify colors and map them into track/obstacle/void?
  -  By mapping ranges of colors onto them?
- How on Godâ€™s earth do we make a reinforcement learning model anyways? Chris hasnâ€™t done this beforeâ€¦ ever.
- Model might work well on a single level but Chris doubts that it can work across levels
- How on earth do we get thru generations quickly enough??
  - Can Ice dodo be slowed down?
  - Each model may take minutes before reward is decided(!!)
    - Therefore going thru a generation of models will take hours, days ðŸ˜¬
